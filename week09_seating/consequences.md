Airlines are testing the use of biometric technology(face and iris scans, or finger print) as a means of improving the traveling experience at airports.

* Using biometric technology to improve passenger experience may come with increased  risks. What happens if hackers get hold of these data stored by airlines?

Facial detection and recognition  have been known to be unreliable when used to capture high-quality videos .
